# Time Block Planner

## Note on the new release (0.7.0)

0.7.0 significantly changes what the plugin looks like and what it does. If you like to have some of the old behaviors back, [consider creating an issue](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner/issues).

If for some reason you still want to use the old version, there are community forks, which you can use via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). [Here is one such fork](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-day-planner-og).

1. Install the plugin
2. Start writing your daily plan in the daily note
